## Why Developer Relations

I've spent my career at the intersection of building developer tools and helping others use them — from IBM's API Connect (used by thousands of API developers) to launching my own open-source projects and creating demos that onboard new contributors. I use AI/LLM tools daily in my workflow, constantly experimenting with new approaches to code generation, agents, and orchestration. I thrive on taking ideas from 0 → 1, explaining complex concepts clearly, and being part of a developer community that's pushing boundaries.
